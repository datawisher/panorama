### Code Conventions
Our code style is almost in line with the standard java conventions (Popular IDE's default setting satisfy this), with the following additional restricts:  
* If there are more than 120 characters in the current line, begin a new line.

* Make sure all new .java files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least a @date tag identifying birth, and preferably at least a paragraph on the intended purpose of the class.

* Add the ASF license header comment to all new .java files (copy from existing files in the project)

* Make sure no @author tag gets appended to the file you contribute to as the @author tag is incompatible with Apache. Rest assured, other ways, including CVS, will ensure transparency, fairness in recording your contributions. 

* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.

* Sufficient unit-tests should accompany new feature development or non-trivial bug fixes. 

* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or another target branch in the main project).

* When writing a commit message, please follow the following conventions: should your commit address an open issue, please add Fixes #XXX at the end of the commit message (where XXX is the issue number).

### Contribution flow

* Fork the current repository

* Push changes in a topic branch to your forked repository.
* Follow the checklist in the pull request template.
* Before sending out the pull request, please sync your forked repository with the remote repository to ensure that your PR is elegant, concise. Reference the guide below:

git fetch upstream
